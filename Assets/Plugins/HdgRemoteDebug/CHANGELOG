2.4.3599
========

Fixes
-----

* Skip fields that are Unity Component references. This fixes the stack overflow that can occur when a reference points to itself.
* Fixed a bug where if a list was empty setting its size would not show the elements of the list because they were all null.
* Fixed a bug where lists of custom structs or classes couldn't be updated.
* Don't serialise classes in lists or arrays if they don't have the Serializable attribute.

New features
------------

* Server port and broadcast port can now be overridden on the Hdg Remote Debug factory.

Fixes
-----

* Improved tree rendering performance significantly when there are thousands of nodes.
* Fixed bug where server broadcast client sometimes doesn't clean up its UdpClient instance.
* Fixed rare bug where multiple servers could exist.

2.3.3529
========

Fixes
-----

* Fixed link.xml not ignoring missing files (should fix build time errors like "UnusedBytecodeStripper2.exe did not run properly!").
* Fixed bug where clicking a scene node in the tree would always select the first thing in the tree.

2.3.3511
========

New features
------------

* Pressing the delete key will now delete the selected nodes.

Fixes
-----

* The fields of a reference are now serialised and can be modified (however, the reference itself cannot be changed).
* Added a default link.xml to ensure Hdg Remote Debug is not stripped by default.

2.2.3499
========

New features
------------

* GameObjects will now appear under a node representing the scene that they are in.
* If a Graphic component is modified, it will now be flagged as dirty, which will force it to refresh itself.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed build helper writing out the wrong assembly name.
* Fixed performance issue when refreshing the tree when there are many GameObjects.

2.1.3460
========

New features
------------

* Added multi-selection of GameObjects in the hierarchy using control and shift. Multi-selected GameObjects can be turned on/off together.
* Added search filter for hierarchy.
* Automatic refresh setting is persisted in EditorPrefs.
* Added BuildHelpers to make enabling/disabling stripping and enabling/disabling Remote Debug plugin DLLs easier in build pipelines.

Fixes
-----

* Only log the "address already in use" message for the server enumerator once.
* Fixed bug where server address popup window was indistinguishable from the remote debug background when using the personal skin.
* Set script execution order for RemoteDebugServerFactory so it runs as early as possible.
* Don't refresh components if there is no selected GameObject (fixes 'ArgumentOutOfRangeException').
* Search through all loaded assemblies for Hdg.RemoteDebugServer type by string name instead of concrete type in case the DLL was never loaded and to avoid pulling in the DLL.
* Only refresh components when 'refresh' is pressed, if 'automatic refresh' is enabled, if the selection changes, or if a property is changed.

2.0.3382
========

Fixes
-----

* Use string names for types instead of the Type object, in case they have been stripped out of a build.
* Fixed bug where when an app is backgrounded, the server would sometimes throw a NullReferenceException.
* Breaking change: Renamed RemoveDontDestroyOnLoadObjects -> RemoveDontDestroyOnLoadObject (singular).
* If server is destroying itself, also remove itself from the don't destroy on load list.
* When a SocketException occurs in the server Update(), just stop and start listening again (fixes bug where locking iPhone and then opening up again would never restart the server).
* Factory script no longer creates the server if it already exists, and destroys itself (fixes bug where loading back into a scene with the server would cause a server to be created and immediately destroyed).
* Fixed bug where if a gob is in the current scene and marked as DontDestroyOnLoad it would appear twice.
* Recursively search children of DontDestroyOnLoad objects.
* Guard against null GameObjects in the DontDestroyOnLoadObjects list, and only log a warning message the first time one is found.
* Disabled some debug spam.

2.0.3354
========

New features
------------

* DontDestroyOnLoad objects can be manually added and removed to the server for tracking.
* Finally out of beta!

Fixes
-----

* Fixed bug where EditorPrefs would be queried from constructor (which Unity doesn't like) rather than OnEnable.

2.0.3342 Beta
=============

New features
------------

* The five most recently added custom servers now persist via EditorPrefs.

2.0.3331 Beta
=============

Fixes
-----

* Check if scene is valid when getting root objects.
* Disabled showing of DontDestroyOnLoad objects because there isn't a reliable way to get this information at runtime.

2.0.3321 Beta
=============

New features
------------

* Added a button to turn off automatic refreshing of the hierarchy. The user must manually press the "refresh" button to get an updated list.

Fixes
-----

* Refresh GameObject list message is no longer sent if there is already one outstanding, so we don't queue up thousands.
* If a 'get components' message was received by the server and the GameObject can't be found, "GameObject not found" will be displayed in the component panel.
* Messages are serialised from the write thread to avoid blocking the main thread even more.
* The inner exception is now logged when using the Hdg.Button attribute, rather than the generic "invoke failed" exception.

2.0.3287 Beta
=============

Fixes
-----

* Fixed bug where only GameObjects from the first active scene would appear, rather than all active scenes.
* Fixed bug where DontDestroyOnLoad objects would not be shown.

2.0.3266 Beta
=============

New features
------------

* Added support for Unity 4.6.8 - 5.3.1.

2.0.3251 Beta
=============

New features
------------

* Added support for UWP.
* Added support for connecting to a custom IP address.
* Added support for serialising arrays of structs.

Fixes
-----

* Server prefab now dynamically creates the real server instance because we can't keep a reference to the MonoBehaviour, since we don't know what DLL will be loaded (e.g. UWP or non-UWP).
* Big refactor of serialisation so it will work with UWP.
* Use the reload scripts attribute to detect reload instead of hacky method.
* In OnDisable, do a disconnect (seems to fix reload blocking).
* If selected object has been removed then clear the selection.
* Fixed bug where if a list or array was null the property wouldn't show up at all.
* Fixed bug with foldouts in arrays where expanding e.g. a vec4 in one element would expand all of them.
* Fixed bug where arrays nested in structs wouldn't have their sizes updated.
* Send a set array size message to the server when array/list sizes are changed.
* Fixed lists rendering the size property for lists of rdt.property (it shouldn't be).
* Fixed bug where setting a larger size on an array or list  would fail to add new items, and setting a smaller size would only remove one item instead of the difference.
* Fixed lists not rendering in inspector.
* Fixed List<> not being serialised.
* Fixed bug where updating would reconstruct the hierarchy in the reverse order, causing fields on user structs to not be updated on the server.

1.0.3050 Beta
=============

* Initial public release.
